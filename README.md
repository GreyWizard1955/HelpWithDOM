I have a Select statement, a Button, and three Sliders. The Select statement 
has a certain number of colors, the Button selects the color to be chosen, 
and the three Sliders represent the Red, Green, and Blue values represented. 
The way that I am doing it right now is deleting the Sliders and re-adding 
them to reset the values. Anytime I try to set the values, I get an error. 

Help me, please!
